On October 17, 2023, [Hamish
Hamilton](Hamish_Hamilton_(director) "wikilink") was announced as
director.[55] On November 15, [Jimmy Kimmel](Jimmy_Kimmel "wikilink")
was announced as host, returning for the second consecutive year and
fourth Academy Awards overall.[56] On November 30, 2023,
[ABC](American_Broadcasting_Company "wikilink") and the Academy
announced that the start time of the ceremony would be moved up by an
hour to 4:00 p.m. PT (7:00 p.m. ET).[57] This change enabled ABC to air
a half-hour of [primetime](Prime_time "wikilink") programming as a
[lead-out](Broadcast_programming#Lead-ins_and_lead-outs "wikilink"),
featuring a new episode of its sitcom *[Abbott
Elementary](Abbott_Elementary "wikilink")*.[58] An [American Sign
Language](American_Sign_Language "wikilink") livestream was broadcast on
the Academy's [YouTube](YouTube "wikilink") page featuring video of
interpreters.[59]

The [pre-show](Academy_Awards_pre-show "wikilink") was hosted for the
third consecutive year by [Vanessa Hudgens](Vanessa_Hudgens "wikilink"),
joined by new co-host [Julianne Hough](Julianne_Hough "wikilink").[60]
Due to the scheduling change, the pre-show was shortened to 30
minutes.[61] The beginning of the ceremony was delayed by six minutes,
due to arrivals being slowed by [Israel–Hamas war
protests](Israel–Hamas_war_protests_in_the_United_States "wikilink")
outside of the theatre.[62][63][64]

On January 29, 2024, comedian and broadcaster [Amelia
Dimoldenberg](Amelia_Dimoldenberg "wikilink"), host of the
[YouTube](YouTube "wikilink") interview series *[Chicken Shop
Date](Amelia_Dimoldenberg#Chicken_Shop_Date "wikilink")*, was announced
as the [social media](social_media "wikilink") ambassador and [red
carpet](red_carpet "wikilink") correspondent. Dimoldenberg was involved
in multiple [Oscar season](Oscar_season "wikilink") events, including
the Oscars Nominees luncheon, where she participated in an Academy video
production with nominees. She was also involved interviewing people at
the Oscars red carpet and the "Oscars 96 Behind the Scenes Tour".[65]

Presenters were announced in a series of groups beginning on February
26, 2024.[66][67][68] Performers were announced on February 28,
2024.[69][70] After the first batch of presenters was announced, *[The
Hollywood Reporter](The_Hollywood_Reporter "wikilink")* learned that the
Academy would revive a popular presenting format previously used in
[2009](81st_Academy_Awards "wikilink"),[71] where five Oscar-winning
actors for leading and supporting performances took the stage together
to introduce the current nominees in their respective categories.[72]
[David Alan Grier](David_Alan_Grier "wikilink") was selected as the
event's announcer.[73]

Production designers Alana Billingsley and Misty Buckley designed the
stage over the course of nine months. According to Billingsley and
Buckley, they were inspired by [contemporary
spaces](Contemporary_architecture "wikilink") where people can "meet,
exchange, create \[like\] a modern-day
[plaza](Town_square "wikilink")".[74] Throughout the ceremony, the stage
subtly changed its design to honor the nominees; the screenplay
categories included images of real [typewriters](typewriter "wikilink"),
while the [Best Costume
Design](Academy_Award_for_Best_Costume_Design "wikilink") category
showcased images of several of the nominated costumes.[75]

[Messi the Dog](Messi_(dog) "wikilink") from *[Anatomy of a
Fall](Anatomy_of_a_Fall "wikilink")* attended the ceremony and had his
own seat in the audience. According to *[The Hollywood
Reporter](The_Hollywood_Reporter "wikilink")*, multiple companies with
nominated films had complained to the Academy about him attending the
Oscar nominees luncheon and giving the film an advantage for voting.[76]
Before the ceremony, the show's host, [Jimmy
Kimmel](Jimmy_Kimmel "wikilink"), shared a video in which he could be
seen rehearsing his Oscars jokes with Messi. He also made a surprise
appearance in the audience of the show and appeared to urinate on [Matt
Damon](Matt_Damon "wikilink")'s star on the [Hollywood Walk of
Fame](Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame "wikilink") as part of the ongoing
[Damon–Kimmel feud](Damon–Kimmel_feud "wikilink").[77]

Nominees [Kaouther Ben Hania](Kaouther_Ben_Hania "wikilink"), [Finneas
O'Connell](Finneas_O'Connell "wikilink"), [Billie
Eilish](Billie_Eilish "wikilink"), and [Mark
Ruffalo](Mark_Ruffalo "wikilink"), as well as presenters [Ramy
Youssef](Ramy_Youssef "wikilink") and [Mahershala
Ali](Mahershala_Ali "wikilink"), wore red
[Artists4Ceasefire](Artists4Ceasefire "wikilink") badges calling for a
ceasefire in Gaza.[78][79][80][81]

### Diversity rules

This was the first year that
[diversity](Diversity_(business) "wikilink") rules for the [Best
Picture](Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture "wikilink") category became
mandatory. In June 2020, under its [Academy Aperture
2025](Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture#Diversity_standards "wikilink")
initiative, the academy established a set of "representation and
inclusion standards" that a film would be required to satisfy in order
to compete in the category.[82] For the last two years, filmmakers were
just required to submit a confidential "Academy Inclusion Standards"
form for data purposes only.[83] There are four general standards, of
which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a)
"on-screen representation, themes, and narratives"; (b) "creative
leadership and project team"; (c) "industry access and opportunities";
and (d) "audience development".[84]

As explained by Alissa Wilkinson of *[Vox](Vox_(website) "wikilink")* in
2020, the standards "basically break down into two big buckets:
standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards
promoting more inclusive employment".[85] The standards are intended to
provide greater opportunities for employment for underrepresented racial
and ethnic groups, women, [LGBTQ+](LGBT "wikilink") people, and persons
with
[cognitive](Disabilities_affecting_intellectual_abilities "wikilink") or
[physical disabilities](Physical_disability "wikilink").[86]

### Box office performance of Best Picture nominees

When the nominations were announced, the films nominated for Best
Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.09 billion at the American and
Canadian box offices at the time.[87] *Barbie* was the highest-grossing
film among the Best Picture nominees, with $636 million in domestic box
office receipts. *Oppenheimer* came in second with $327 million. The two
films, comprising the Barbenheimer phenomenon, represented 88% of the
cumulative box office haul generated by Best Picture nominees prior to
their nominations.[88] *Oppenheimer* became the highest-grossing Best
Picture winner since *[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the
King](The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King "wikilink")* at the
[76th Academy Awards](76th_Academy_Awards "wikilink") in 2004. It also
became the first one to gross more than $100 million at the domestic box
office in the decade since *[Argo](Argo_(2012_film) "wikilink")* at the
[85th Academy Awards](85th_Academy_Awards "wikilink") in 2013.[89]

### Reception

The ceremony received mostly positive reviews from critics.[90] [91]
Highlights in reviews included the musical performances of "I'm Just
Ken" and "Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)", [John
Mulaney](John_Mulaney "wikilink") summarizing the plot of *[Field of
Dreams](Field_of_Dreams "wikilink")* while presenting the award for
[Best Sound](Academy_Award_for_Best_Sound "wikilink"), an almost nude
[John Cena](John_Cena "wikilink") presenting [Best Costume
Design](Academy_Award_for_Best_Costume_Design "wikilink") (which Kimmel
billed as marking the 50th anniversary of a [streaking incident at the
1974
ceremony](46th_Academy_Awards#Streaking_incident "wikilink")),[92][93]
and past acting winners introducing this year's nominees.[94][95][96]

*The Zone of Interest* director [Jonathan
Glazer](Jonathan_Glazer "wikilink") received substantial praise and
criticism for his [Best International
Feature](Academy_Award_for_Best_International_Feature_Film "wikilink")
acceptance speech, during which he called for the end of [Israel's
bombardment of
Gaza](Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip_(2023–present) "wikilink").[97]
One sentence from Glazer's speech, in which he said that he and fellow
producer [James Wilson](James_Wilson_(producer) "wikilink") "stand here
as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by
an occupation", was widely misinterpreted and misquoted, with some
sources ending the quote after the words "refute their Jewishness" and
incorrectly suggesting that Glazer was disavowing his Jewish
identity.[98][99][100] Many pro-Israel figures disapproved of the
statement,[101][102] and in the days following the ceremony, over 1,000
Jewish members of the film industry signed an [open
letter](open_letter "wikilink") denouncing Glazer's speech and defending
the actions of the Israeli government.[103][104] Others defended
Glazer's comments, including writer [Tony
Kushner](Tony_Kushner "wikilink")[105] and the director of the
[Auschwitz-Birkenau State
Museum](Auschwitz-Birkenau_State_Museum "wikilink"), where *The Zone of
Interest* is set and where parts of it were filmed.[106]

Conversely, the In Memoriam section received criticism for being too
distracting and the names and faces being so tiny and distant much of
the time that it was difficult recognizing them.[107][108][109] The Best
Picture presentation by [Al Pacino](Al_Pacino "wikilink") was criticized
for not naming the 10 nominees before announcing the
winner.[110][111][112] Clips from the Best Picture nominees had been
shown over the course of the ceremony, and producer Molly McNearney said
to *[Variety](Variety_(magazine) "wikilink")* that the reading of the
nominees was cut "because we were very worried that the show was going
to be long". Similarly, the nominees for Best Original Song were also
not read aloud when handed out by [Cynthia
Erivo](Cynthia_Erivo "wikilink") and [Ariana
Grande](Ariana_Grande "wikilink"), as each of the songs had been
performed earlier in the evening.[113] Acknowledging that it was not his
decision, Pacino later apologized for not listing the nominees, saying
that "to not be fully recognized is offensive and hurtful".[114]

### Ratings

The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 19.5 million people
over its length, which was a 4% increase from the previous year's
ceremony and marking the longest streak of annual ratings increases for
the Academy Awards since [2014](86th_Academy_Awards "wikilink").[115]
However, the show slipped a little among adults ages 18–49 with a 3.81
rating among viewers in that [key
demographic](key_demographic "wikilink"), down 5% from 4.03 rating of
the previous year's ceremony.[116] The viewership peaked in the last
half-hour with 21.9 million total viewers.[117] The ceremony scored the
biggest audience for any awards show since the [92nd Academy
Awards](92nd_Academy_Awards "wikilink") in 2020, and is so far the
largest viewership for any live non-sports entertainment program on U.S.
television in the post–[COVID-19 pandemic](COVID-19_pandemic "wikilink")
era.[118] ABC's *[Abbott Elementary](Abbott_Elementary "wikilink")*
lead-out also benefitted, with the episode reaching a series high in the
18–49 demo (1.42 rating) and total viewership (6.9 million).[119][120]
